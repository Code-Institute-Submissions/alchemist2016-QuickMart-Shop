## Project Background

Welcome to a Milestone 4 Project.

The main aim of this endevour is to provide CRUD Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality to a website.
Also the aim is to provide user with ability to manipulate cart and profile.

This project theme is based on a small online shop idea. Shop that will provide wide range of products.

There is much to say about this topic but my priorities were to present skills in creating a fully operational website connected to PostGress DB and deplayed on Heroku server and AWS S3.

## UX
### User Stories
#### From the users perspective I would like to be able to:

* **see products**
  - all products listed on main page

* **see cart**
  - access current products in cart and add, delete or edit them

* **Admin can Add New Members**
  - Adding new Members into DB 

* **User purchase a product**
  - user can fill out the form and purchase safely

* **User can Contact the Shop Admin**
  - user can write an email to the shop and short description 

#### As a shop, I would like to:
* **attract as many customers as possible**
Promoting wide range of products with a space to advertise

[Back to top](#summary)

### Strategy

**QuickMart** is designed to give oportunity and safety for customers who are interested in buying our products.

### Scope

When I was designing this website I was planing first from backend functionality then the mobile first front end and UI design. The customer can easily surf through the pages and find relevant information about the shop and it's products. Drop down menu in Nav Bar is available as well as burger menu on mobile sizes. All media queries are set to industry standars.

### Structure

User is greated at home page with a list of products with images and description and price. The user has nav bar with menu of all pages available as well as links in the footer. By clicking on a Nav Bar Logo user will be brought to home page.

Next page is Register page where user can get registered if he/she decides to purchase a product. At the Register form  user can use Submit button that will submit his form and create his account. Form is standard style.

Reseting password will affect the information stored in a database also.

If Login button is used user is brought to a new page where user can input his credentials and login into his/hers account.


Next page is Contact Us page where a user can fill out the form and send inquiries to Admin of the shop.

If user is member of the staff after login there is a link for Admin in navbar that takes user to Admin side of the shop app.
If logged in user can logout with a link in navbar.

Once a product has been chosen the user is then taken to Cart by following the link in navbar.

On the checkout page user can see all the products that were chosen and their cost calculated. Also he can fill out the payment form that will process payment through Stripe.

Footer is visible on any page and icons themselves are clickable and leading to clubs LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
All links are target_blank marked and will bring user to a new page opening thus keeping the integrity of the website.

#### Further description of buttons, icons and elements used is in the next section [Features](#existing-features).

### Wireframes


![alt text](https://github.com/alchemist2016/DjangoEcommerceProject/tree/master/readcontents/wireframes "Logo Title Text 1")

### Surface 
I am using throughout the website consistent coloring of Nav Bar and Footer as well as colouring of the forms, buttons, and fonts.

## Features
### Existing Features
* Navigation bar
  -On the top of the Pages is Navigation Bar that is consisted of Logo which is wired to bring back to home page if clicked from any other page. Also on the right hand side is the drop down menu with burger effect and displaying links to all pages. On Mobile size the navbar contains Logo and on the left side a burger menu that links to all pages.

* Footer
  - Footer is always present on all sizes and displays social links that open in new tab.

* Products
  - Products page is consisting of list of products with their price, image, and description. Also there is a button to add that product to your cart.

* Register
  - The form for registration. All fields are required.

* Contact Us 
  - User can use contact form to send an email to Admin. On this page we have a form for the user if they decide to write to the club with their enquiries and questions. The form is connected to EmailJS API and emails to specific address all the queries. It will also print out Success in console window of dev tools.

* Password Reset
 - User can reset password on Login form

* Add User
  - Admin or members of staff can manipulate products and users and all other dutie through Django platform.


* Social icons
  - I have included 2 icons in the Footer that once clicked lead to a new tab with appropriate address and keeping the website always available to the user. For this I have used target=_blank attribute.

### Future Features
  - For the future development I would certainly consider to use much more validation and backfeed to user if anything goes wrong. Also I could reduce the number of pages by introducing more action buttons in some of the forms. Further and more comprehensive testing is needed. UX should be improved with more appealing styling and advertising.

## Deployment
The project was written and developed in the Gitpod IDE.

A local repository was intialized using Github. Regular changes were commited to the local repository.

The process for deployment on Heroku was:

  -Create a new app in Heroku 
  - In the workspace, log into Heroku with command Line and the set of commands provided to create a connection between the application and Heroku.
  - Create a new Git repository and add the files, then associate the Heroku application and push to Heroku once the requirements.txt file and Procfile have been created.
  - Configuration variables must set in order to get the project running. These must be set in both the Gitpod IDE and on Heroku
  - Open the app to test successful deployment.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/alchemist2016/Milestone3.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.  

Further help with cloning can be found on this GitHub Help [page](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Some of the commands used in deployment
The app was written and developed on Gitpod and was regularly committed and pushed to Github and Heroku.
The following pip commands are necessary for the app to function properly. 
<pre><code>
pip3 install django==1.11.29
django-admin startproject file_name .
django-admin startapp app_name
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
pip3 install django_forms_bootstrap
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install dj_database_url
pip3 install psycopg2
pip3 install django-storages
pip3 install boto3
pip3 install stripe
pip3 install gunicorn
</code></pre>
Add all secret keys to heroku config vars and add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and make itâ€™s value 1
python3 manage.py collectstatic
Need to run this after any changes to static files in the IDE
Heroku required that some variables are set up in order to deploy the app. All secret keys and passwords used in the env.py 
file which is ignored by Github in the .gitignore file are stored in the config vars section of Heroku. In order to send the app to 
Heroku I first had to login into Heroku through the Gitpod IDE and then push all the commits to Heroku so any changes could be added 
to the app, on the last few pushes the Debug was set to False
To set up and install AWS I followed the instruction video on the Code Institutes training and the following steps were taken. If you don't 
have an amazon account you need to open one and select amazon web services (AWS) and then S3.
In AWS S3
Create Bucket
Unique name ie - vladimir-ecommerce Ireland Allow public access
Create
Open bucket Properties - staic website hosting Index.html
Error.html
Permissions Cors configuraton Add our ARN keeping /*
IAM Create a group Name it close to buket name - neils ecommerce-group Next and create group
Create policy Import managed policy Choose S3 full policy Import Change string to a list [ ] The first item in the list is going to be our own ARN which
we used earlier, but it has been closed in quotes The second item in the list again in quotes is going to be the same ARN This time we append a forward 
 slash and an asterisk Review and name it in association with the bucket - vladimir-ecommerce-policy
Add policy to group Got to groups and select my group, goto permissions tap in group search for the policy we created and check the box and attach
Create user New user Name - vladimir-eccomerce-user Allow programatic access No keys or tags Download CSV file
Add this to settings.py above static_url
<pre><code>
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000'
}
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'ecommerce'
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get("AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID")
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = '%s.s3.amazonaws.com' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
</code></pre>
Add AWS keys to env.py file using CSV information next Python3 manage.py collectstatic Yes to change warning
Custom_storages.py file
<pre><code>
from django.conf import settings 
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage 
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
  location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage): location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION ADD these changes to staticfiles in settings.py
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static' 
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage' 
</code></pre>
And Python3 manage.py collectstatic
Do similar action for media To fix console errors In permissions - Cors configuration Copy the GET line and change it to HEAD to read font awesome CSS properly
